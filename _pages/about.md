I am an incoming grad student at UC San Diego, admitted to ECE MLDS program. I completed my undergraduate studies in June 2020. From then, I was working on a project under **'[AI vs. COVID-19 Initiative](https://www.aivscovid19.org/)'** as a part of the Stanford Response Innovation Lab. My research interests lie in -
- Biomedical Imgaing.
- Intersection of Embedded systems and Machine learning.
- Computer Vision.
